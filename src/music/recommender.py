"""Rule-based emotion-driven music recommender.

Deliberately simple and fully explainable (docs/RECOMMENDATION.md): look up the
valence/energy/tempo target range for a detected emotion, pull a bounded
candidate pool from the local catalogue, then randomly sample a playlist from
it. No machine learning, no personalisation — the behaviour is deterministic
under a fixed seed, which is what the tests rely on.

Sampling is two-stage so the whole matching set is reachable, not just one slice
of it: a random start point on the ``sample_key`` index selects a random window
of the candidates (Stage 1), then a random draw picks the playlist from that
window (Stage 2). An unordered ``LIMIT`` alone would always return the same
low-valence rows in index order.
