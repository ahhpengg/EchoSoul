# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for Claude Code

This file is the entry point for Claude Code when working on this repository. Read this first, then follow links to deeper documentation in `docs/` as needed.

## What this project is

**EchoSoul** (full academic title: *AI-Based Emotion-Driven Music Recommendation System Using Face Analysis*) — a desktop application that captures a user's facial photo via webcam, classifies their emotion using a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B3 CNN, then generates a Spotify-streamable playlist that matches the detected emotion.

> **Naming note:** The product is branded **EchoSoul**. The local MySQL database is named **`echosoul`** (set via `DB_NAME` in `.env`). The old name `emotion_music` was swept from the docs and code. **Exception:** the rule **table** is still named `emotion_music_mapping` (and its seed file `data/seed/emotion_music_mapping.sql`) — that is a schema identifier, deliberately left unchanged.

This is a **BSc (Hons) Computer Science capstone project** at Sunway University. The owner is the sole developer. The project has two phases:

- **Capstone Project 1 (CP1):** Planning, research, design — already completed (Sept 2025 – Jan 2026). The full planning document (the source of truth for design decisions) is referenced throughout these docs.
- **Capstone Project 2 (CP2):** Implementation, testing, evaluation — runs May–July 2026. This is what we are building.

The project follows the **Waterfall methodology** with weekly supervisor check-ins. Phases must be completed and documented in order: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Integration & Testing → Operation & Maintenance.

## Core user flow (one-paragraph summary)

User launches the desktop app → logs into Spotify (one-time OAuth) → on home screen, chooses either *"Take Photo"* (webcam) or *"Choose Mood Manually"* → if photo, system detects exactly one face, preprocesses the ROI, runs it through the EfficientNet-B3 emotion classifier, and maps the result (happy / surprised / sad / angry / neutral) to a valence–energy–tempo target range → system queries the local MySQL music catalogue for songs matching that range, randomises a subset into a playlist, and displays it → user can play the playlist (Spotify Web Playback SDK streams to the embedded webview), save it, edit it, or re-take the photo.

If detection fails (no face, multiple faces, blurry, dark, or detected emotion is outside the supported scope — e.g. *fear* or *disgust*), the system shows an error page and routes the user back to the home screen.

## Tech stack (locked unless noted)

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.11 | Match TensorFlow 2.x stable support; avoid 3.12+ until confirmed. |
| Deep learning | TensorFlow 2.x + Keras API | `tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB3` with ImageNet weights. |
| Face detection | OpenCV Haar Cascade (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) | Capstone plan specifies this. Simple and adequate; if accuracy is poor at integration time, swap to MediaPipe Face Detection — but only with supervisor sign-off. |
| FER dataset | RAF-DB (already downloaded by owner) | 7 basic emotion classes; we collapse to 5 (drop fear & disgust) at the application layer, not at training time — see `docs/FER_MODEL.md`. |
| Database | MySQL 8.x | Stores music catalogue, emotion–music mapping rules, user playlists. |
| Music catalogue source | 3 pre-built Kaggle datasets, merged (see `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md`) | Spotify `/audio-features` was deprecated for new apps on **27 Nov 2024**, so we cannot fetch features at runtime. We use static dumps. |
| Music streaming | Spotify Web Playback SDK (JavaScript, in the embedded webview) | **Requires Spotify Premium** for every user. Disclosed in capstone report. |
| Spotify Web API (auxiliary) | Spotipy 2.x | Used only for OAuth flow + artist-genre enrichment script. The deprecated `/audio-features` endpoint is **NOT** used. |
| Desktop wrapper | PyWebView 5.x | Embeds HTML/CSS/JS frontend inside a native window; bridges Python ↔ JavaScript. |
| Frontend | HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript | No React/Vue. Keep dependencies minimal for a solo capstone. Spotify Playback SDK is plain JS, so vanilla integrates cleanly. |
| Version control | Git + GitHub (private repo) | |
| IDE | VS Code | |

**Do not introduce new frameworks or libraries without explicit owner approval.** If a task seems to call for one (e.g. "use Flask"), pause and confirm first. The dependency surface is intentionally small.

## Critical context — read this before writing any code

### 1. The supported emotion scope is 5, not 7

RAF-DB labels 7 basic emotions: **happy, surprised, sad, angry, neutral, fear, disgust**. The system supports only the first 5 for music recommendation because the user survey (see CP1 planning doc §3.2) showed users rarely listen to music intentionally when feeling fear or disgust.

**Decision: train the model on all 7 classes, then filter at the application layer.** Reasoning:
- More training data per class → better feature learning.
- The "out-of-scope detected" error page (already designed in the planning doc) is the user-facing handler for *fear* and *disgust* predictions.
- Future scope expansion stays low-cost.

Do **not** drop fear/disgust at the dataset level. See `docs/FER_MODEL.md`.

### 2. Spotify `/audio-features` is dead for this project

On **27 November 2024**, Spotify deprecated the `/audio-features`, `/audio-analysis`, `/recommendations`, `/related-artists`, and featured/category playlist endpoints for any new third-party app. New apps registered after that date receive HTTP 403.

Implications:
- We **cannot** call `/audio-features` at runtime to enrich tracks.
- We **must** use pre-built dumps for valence/energy/tempo (see `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md`).
- Spotify Web Playback SDK is **not** affected — playback still works.
- ⚠️ **Update (June 2026):** `/artists` genre data is **also gone** for this app — the batch `/artists?ids=...` endpoint returns 403, and the single-artist object no longer includes a `genres` field at all (verified empirically). Genre enrichment therefore uses **Last.fm** (`artist.getTopTags`, keyed by artist name), not Spotify. See `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md` Stage 3. Needs `LASTFM_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- Do not write code that calls the deprecated endpoints, even in fallback paths.

### 3. Music data is local; playback is remote

The 1.2M-track merged catalogue lives in MySQL on the user's machine. Recommendation logic runs entirely against the local DB. Spotify is contacted **only** to play a track — we pass the `track_id` to the Web Playback SDK, which streams audio from Spotify's servers to the embedded webview.

This means:
- The recommender works offline (after initial DB seed).
- Playback requires internet + Spotify Premium login.
- Every track in our DB must have a valid Spotify `track_id` so playback works.

### 4. Every user needs Spotify Premium

The Web Playback SDK does not stream to Free accounts. This is a hard Spotify policy, not a workaround we can fix. The capstone report discloses this; the app's first-run screen should make it explicit before the user attempts OAuth.

### 5. Privacy-sensitive data — webcam images

Captured facial images:
- Are processed in-memory only.
- Are **never** written to disk except in explicit debug mode (off by default).
- Are **never** transmitted to any external service.
- Are discarded immediately after emotion prediction.

This is a hard requirement. Do not add features (analytics, "save photo," cloud backup, telemetry) that would violate it.

> **Known third-party exception (disclosed, not image data):** the MediaPipe dependency embeds Google's "Clearcut" usage-telemetry client, which periodically reports library-usage events (solution name, platform info — never images) to `play.googleapis.com/log` and cannot be disabled in the PyPI wheel. Accepted + disclosed in the capstone report — full analysis and suggested report wording in `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` § "MediaPipe usage telemetry".

## Working conventions for Claude Code

### Documentation-first

Before writing code for a module:
1. Read the relevant doc in `docs/` (e.g. `docs/FER_MODEL.md` before touching `src/fer/`).
2. If the doc is silent on a design point, ask the owner — do not invent a convention.
3. If the doc is wrong or out of date, fix the doc first, then the code.

### Small, reviewable changes

The owner is a single developer reviewing every diff. Prefer:
- One concern per commit.
- Working code at every commit (no half-implementations).
- Clear commit messages: `module: short imperative summary` (e.g. `fer: add Haar cascade face detection`).

### No silent dependency additions

If a task seems to require a new pip package, stop and confirm with the owner first. Adding `requests` is fine; adding `fastapi` or `pytorch` is not.

### Style

- Python: PEP 8, formatted with `black`, type hints on public functions, docstrings on non-trivial functions. Line length 100.
- JavaScript: 2-space indent, ES2020+, no transpilation step (PyWebView's embedded webview is Chromium-based, modern JS is fine).
- SQL: uppercase keywords, snake_case identifiers, one statement per line in migrations.

See `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md` for the full conventions.

### Tests

- Every module in `src/` gets a matching `tests/` file.
- Unit tests use `pytest`.
- The FER model has a fixed test image (a known-happy face) checked into `tests/fixtures/` to verify the inference pipeline end-to-end.
- The recommendation algorithm has a fixed seed for randomised playlist selection so tests are deterministic.

See `docs/TESTING.md`.

### Long-running scripts are background-safe

The artist-genre enrichment script (`scripts/enrich_artist_genres.py`) must:
- Checkpoint progress to disk every 1,000 API batches.
- Resume from the last checkpoint if interrupted.
- Handle Spotify 429 responses by honouring the `Retry-After` header.

Do not write enrichment code that has to complete in one shot. See `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md`.

## Status (update this section as the project progresses)

- **Phase:** CP2 — Phase 3 (Implementation & Unit Testing), as of July 2026.
- **Completed so far:**
  - **Frontend scaffold (Track F, partial):** pages, CSS, and JS for home / photo / mood / loading / result / error (not yet wired to a Python bridge).
  - **Track C — FER (DONE):** trained EfficientNet-B3 model dropped in (`models/fer_model.keras`, 86.68% 7-class / 87.62% 5-in-scope). Grayscale architecture (`src/fer/model.py`) + training script (`scripts/train_fer_model.py`); runtime image pipeline (`src/fer/image_pipeline.py` — MediaPipe Tasks `FaceLandmarker` eye-alignment + square crop, same landmark topology as `scripts/align_facial_images`, exactly-one-face gate, blur/dark/bright quality checks); inference + out-of-scope wrapper (`src/fer/inference.py`); tests in `tests/fer/`. The as-built training setup diverged from the original plan (grayscale `[0,255]` input, categorical focal loss, MixUp, block4+ unfreeze) — `docs/FER_MODEL.md` and `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` were rewritten to match. Local inference runs on `tensorflow==2.21.0` + `mediapipe==0.10.35` (installed; `requirements.txt` regenerated). Face detection uses the Tasks `FaceLandmarker` API (needs `models/face_landmarker.task`) because mediapipe 0.10.35 removed the legacy `solutions` API. All 22 `tests/fer` pass, including an end-to-end happy-face photo → "happy" prediction.
  - **Track A — Database (DONE):** migration runner (`src/db/migrate.py`), connection pool (`src/db/connection.py`), schema migrations (`music`, `emotion_music_mapping`, `playlist`, `playlist_song`, `v_in_scope_music`), 5-row rule seed, indexes, passing tests (`tests/db/`). Migrations applied to the local `echosoul` database.
  - **Track B — Music data pipeline (DONE):** the five-stage pipeline (`scripts/download_datasets.py` → `normalise_datasets.py` → `enrich_artist_genres.py` (Last.fm) → `merge_catalogues.py` → `seed_database.py`) is written and has been **run end-to-end**. The merged catalogue is loaded into the local `echosoul` DB: **1,310,164 rows** in `music`, all three indexes present, 5-row rule table populated.
  - **Track D — Recommendation (DONE):** rule lookup + candidate query + random sample (`src/music/recommender.py`) and playlist save/load/delete (`src/music/playlists.py`), with deterministic-seed integration tests against the real catalogue (`tests/music/`). Validated now that Track B data is loaded.
  - **Track E — Spotify integration (DONE):** keyring token cache with file fallback (`src/spotify/keyring_cache.py`, service `EchoSoul`, `WinVaultKeyring` backend on Windows), PKCE auth flow (`src/spotify/auth.py` — `has_spotify_session`, `start_login_flow`, `get_valid_access_token`, `logout`), Premium check + cached profile (`src/spotify/account.py` — `verify_premium`, `get_user_profile`). 27 mocked-Spotipy/keyring unit tests pass (`tests/spotify/`). Added the `keyring==25.7.0` dependency (owner-approved) and regenerated `requirements.txt`. `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` was corrected to the real spotipy 2.26 API (no `as_dict`; `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` env name). Redirect URI is a **fixed-port loopback with a custom path**, `http://127.0.0.1:8888/echosoul-callback` (Spotify's dashboard rejects `localhost` and port-less forms as "not secure"); login uses our own `_CallbackServer` (branded page + CSRF `state`) rather than Spotipy's built-in server. **Manual E2E OAuth run verified (2026-07-08):** real browser login succeeded end-to-end — token cached in the OS keychain, `get_valid_access_token()` returns a valid token, and `verify_premium()` confirmed the owner's account is **Premium** (required for the Web Playback SDK).
  - **Track F — F1: entry point + bridge (DONE):** PyWebView entry point (`src/main.py` — window over `frontend/index.html`, MySQL fail-fast check at startup, FER warm-up on a `webview.start(func=...)` worker thread, `private_mode=False` so the Spotify SDK's localStorage persists across runs, `ECHOSOUL_DEBUG=1` opens devtools; launch with `python -m src.main`) + the full JS bridge (`src/api/bridge.py`, one flat `BridgeApi` bound as `js_api`): Spotify session/account passthroughs, `detect_emotion` (pipeline → inference; maps the model's RAF-DB label **`surprise` → app vocabulary `surprised`**, which the frontend/rule table/recommender use; a module lock serialises MediaPipe/TF access because PyWebView runs each bridge call on its own thread), `quick_face_check` (≤320 px downscale, decode failure ⇒ `face_count: 0`), `generate_playlist`, and playlist CRUD (save/list/load/rename/delete, with JS float→int coercion). 20 mocked unit tests in `tests/api/` (110 total pass). Installed `pywebview==5.4` (locked-stack item; 6.2.1 exists but the stack table locks 5.x) and regenerated `requirements.txt`.
  - **Track F — F2: auth gate + login/premium pages (DONE):** `frontend/js/bridge.js` (`callPy` / `callPyWithTimeout` — waits for `pywebviewready`, 30 s default timeout, per-call override); `frontend/index.html` rewritten as the real auth gate + `js/auth_gate.js` (session → Premium → home, `location.replace` so the gate stays out of back-history; on session-restore failure it does **not** logout — a transient network error must not destroy a good refresh token — it routes to login with a one-shot `sessionStorage.login_notice`); `pages/login.html` + `js/login.js` (login call uses a **190 s** bridge timeout so Python's 180 s OAuth wait times out first); `pages/premium_required.html` + `js/premium_required.js` (upgrade link via new **`open_external_url`** bridge method — allowlisted to `https://www.spotify.com/` so the webview never navigates away; re-check via gate re-run; switch-account via logout). Both new pages are chrome-less (pre-auth) Vibe Canvas glass cards. `tests/api` now 25 tests.
  - **Track F — custom title bar & branding polish (DONE):** window is now **frameless** with an in-page title bar (`frontend/js/titlebar.js`, loaded on all 9 pages): min/max/close buttons injected into the chrome pages' top app bar (spare header space = `pywebview-drag-region` drag handle; dbl-click = maximize) and a slim overlay strip on the pre-auth pages. New `window_minimize` / `window_toggle_maximize` / `window_close` / `window_is_maximized` bridge methods (maximized state read from the native `FormWindowState`, verified `str()` == "Maximized" on the real backend). `src/main.py`: title-bar/taskbar icon via WinForms `Form.Icon` (**must** wait for `events.shown` + marshal via `Form.Invoke` — worker-thread assignment fails silently), explicit `AppUserModelID` (else the taskbar shows the Python icon), DWM rounded corners on Win11, `frameless=True, easy_drag=False`. Branding: `frontend/assets/img/app.ico` + `logo-96.png` generated from `logo.png`; OAuth callback page restyled to Vibe Canvas colours with the logo inlined as a data URI (the one-shot callback server can't serve assets); login/premium pages use owner-supplied Spotify glyphs (`spotify-black.png` on the green button, `spotify-green.png` on the premium badge, both with `onerror` hide). Frameless windows get no native resize borders from the WinForms backend, so `titlebar.js` also injects invisible edge/corner handles driving `window_begin_resize(edge)` (captures the anchor rect **once**, returns the size baseline) + streamed `window_resize(w, h)` steps (absolute `SetWindowPos` from that anchor). ⚠️ pywebview's own `resize(fix_point=...)` must NOT be used for drags — it re-reads cached form bounds per call and the race compounds until the window walks off-screen (hit this live). Clamped to `MIN_WINDOW_WIDTH/HEIGHT` (shared constants in `src/api/bridge.py`, reused by `main.py`'s `min_size`); CSS-px→native-px scale factor calibrated at drag start (owner's display runs ~120% scaling — verified live). `tests/api` now 34 tests.
  - **Track F — Free-account soft gate (DONE, owner-built):** the Premium gate became a **soft** gate — `premium_required.html` offers "Continue without playback"; Free mode stashes the profile in `sessionStorage.spotify_profile` the same way the auth gate does for Premium. Downstream, `chrome.js` hides the bottom player and `result.js` drops play-all + opens each track in Spotify via `open_external_url` (allowlist extended to `https://open.spotify.com/`).
  - **Track F — F3: home + live sidebar (DONE):** new `frontend/js/sidebar.js` (module, loaded on all six chrome pages) fills the `#sidebar-playlists` shell chrome.js now renders: rows from `list_user_playlists` (emotion emoji, name, song count), click → `result.html#playlist=<id>`, kebab menu with inline rename (`rename_playlist`) and two-step delete (`delete_playlist` — PyWebView has no reliable `confirm()`; deleting the playlist open on the result page routes home). Shared helpers extracted to `frontend/js/playlists_ui.js` (`EMOTION_THEMES`, `trackRow`, `dbTrack`, duration/meta formatting, Free-mode open-in-Spotify) — `result.js` and `home.js` refactored onto it. `result.js` gained the **saved-playlist view** (`#playlist=<id>` → `load_playlist`; no mood banner; "Playlist not found" fallback; reloads on `hashchange` so switching playlists from the result page re-renders). Home's static "Crying TT" section replaced by a live **"Your latest playlist"** showcase (newest saved, first 5 tracks + view-all row; hidden while nothing is saved). Header: notifications button removed (owner request); **profile chip** shows the Spotify display-name initial and opens an account dropdown (name / email / Premium-Free badge + Log out — direct `pywebview.api.logout()` since chrome.js is a plain script, then `login.html`).
  - **Track F — F4: photo page webcam (DONE):** new `frontend/js/camera.js` (module; replaced the placeholder `photo.js`). Live `getUserMedia` preview (1280×720 ideal, CSS-mirrored selfie view — captured data is NOT mirrored), 2 Hz `quick_face_check` pings (≤320 px JPEG payload; chained `setTimeout` with an in-flight guard so pings never pile up behind the FER lock; 5 s per-ping timeout, failures lock the shutter and keep retrying) driving the oval guide (green = exactly one face = shutter enabled; red = none/several) + a status line. Shutter grabs the **full-res lossless PNG** (per `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md`), freezes it, offers Retake / "Use this photo"; Use stores `sessionStorage.captured_image_b64` + `emotion_source="camera"` → `loading.html` (the `detect_emotion` call there is F6). Stream stopped on `pagehide`; camera-unavailable shows a reason + "Try camera again". `photo.html` gained the frozen-frame `<img>`, status line, captured-state buttons and retry block.
  - **Track F — F5: mood page (DONE):** the manual path was already wired (mood cards / home quick chips → `sessionStorage.last_emotion` + `emotion_source="manual"` → `loading.html`); F5 finished it with sessionStorage hygiene — a manual pick now drops any `captured_image_b64` left by an abandoned photo run (a full-res PNG is multi-MB that would otherwise live for the whole session) — and a picked-once guard so a fast second click can't swap the emotion after navigation to loading is already queued (`mood.js`, `home.js`). `docs/FRONTEND.md`'s mood snippet corrected to as-built (`.mood-card`, plain `loading.html` — no `?next=result`; `loading.js` branches on `emotion_source` alone).
  - **Track F — F6: loading/result/error on the real backend (DONE):** `loading.js` rewritten as the flow's engine (module): camera path reads `captured_image_b64` (**removed immediately — consumed either way**) → `detect_emotion`; pipeline errors / out-of-scope set `error_code` (+ `detected_emotion`) → `error.html`; manual path skips inference; both → `generate_playlist(emotion)` (backend default 25) → `current_playlist` + `playlist_emotion` → `result.html`. All exits via `location.replace` (transient page, inputs consumed — Back must never re-run it; history reads photo → result), ~1.5 s minimum display so the animation doesn't flash, no-flow entry bounces home, empty playlist ⇒ `playlist_failed`, rejected bridge promise ⇒ `unexpected`. New `frontend/js/error_handler.js` (plain script on `error.html`): FRONTEND.md's message table + `playlist_failed`/fallback; keys read not consumed (refresh keeps the message); no code ⇒ static prototype copy stays (design preview). `result.js` detection view now renders the real stashed tracks (per-emotion copy kept as `metaLead` + real `formatPlaylistMeta` counts; no state ⇒ `location.replace` home) and wires the **save button** (`#save-playlist-btn`): `save_playlist` named `Happy — Jul 12, 9:41 PM`, on success bookmark fills with the emotion accent + stays disabled + DIY toast (no reliable `alert()` in PyWebView) + `refreshSidebarPlaylists()` imported from `sidebar.js` (same module instance — ES module cache) shows the row live; saved view removes the save button. Edit button = `data-placeholder` (edit mode deferred). Loading's progress bar (`#loading-progress`) is **staged-real**: width + CSS transition glides toward a per-stage cap while the bridge call runs (55% detect, 90% playlist — no real per-call percentage exists), finishing fill to 100% timed to land just before navigation; error exits freeze it in place. Not yet run against the real app — first full camera→playlist E2E happens with the F9 manual checklist.
  - **Track F — F7: Web Playback SDK (DONE):** new `frontend/js/playback.js` (module on the five bottom-player chrome pages — home/mood/loading/result/error; no-ops for Free accounts and when the footer is absent). SDK script injected **dynamically** (onerror ⇒ "Playback unavailable" idle state, offline-safe); `Spotify.Player` device **"EchoSoul"**, token via `get_spotify_access_token`. File navigation kills the SDK per page, so **cross-page continuity is server-side**: `pagehide` stashes `sessionStorage.playback_resume` (`"playing"|"paused"`) + `player.disconnect()`; the next page's `ready` transfers the session to its new `device_id` (resumes mid-track after a sub-second gap). **No unconditional transfer on ready** (would hijack the user's phone/desktop session — deliberate deviation from the CP1 sketch, doc updated); only a page that reached `ready` may clear the stash (the short-lived loading page must leave it for result to consume). Un-gestured resume needs `src/main.py`'s `_set_webview2_browser_args()` — ⚠️ `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS` **overrides** pywebview's programmatic args (verified live; losing `--allow-file-access-from-files` kills every ES module on `file://` — the function restates pywebview 5.x's flags + ours); `autoplay_failed` still handled (toast "press play"). Bottom player: `chrome.js` now renders it idle with IDs (transport disabled) and `playback.js` drives it — title/artists/album art, waveform bars = live progress **and seek bar** (1 s `getCurrentState` poll while playing — local extrapolation lied on stalled sessions), hover volume slider + mute (volume persists via `sessionStorage.playback_volume`); queue button stays placeholder. **Transport = Web API commands** (resume/next/previous/seek/shuffle with `device_id`), NOT the SDK's local methods — after a paused transfer the device has metadata but no loaded media and `togglePlay`/`nextTrack`/`seek` silently no-op (verified live); pause stays local (`player.pause()`), with an optimistic icon/state flip so pause-then-navigate stashes the right resume state. Errors funnel to `onSdkError`: auth ⇒ gate redirect **once per session** (loop guard), playback ⇒ toast (deliberately no auto-skip), init/account ⇒ unavailable state. `playTracks(trackIds, startIndex)` exported for `result.js`: waits for `ready` (12 s), `activateElement()`, PUT `/me/player/play` with `uris`+`offset` (one 700 ms retry on 404 — a fresh device may not be registered server-side yet). `result.js` wires play-all (button + cover overlay) and per-track row clicks (queue starts at that track) in **both** views; `showToast` moved to and `trackRow(…, onPlay)` extended in `playlists_ui.js`. **Verified live (2026-07-14, F8 session):** real audio in the webview (Widevine works in WebView2, fresh profile), play-all, honest player UI, pause/resume, cross-page resume (~sub-second gap; track may restart near its beginning if Spotify's last-synced position was early).
  - **Track F — F8: styling pass (DONE, via live screenshot audit):** drove the real app over CDP (`webview.settings["REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT"]` + Node WebSocket driver + `Page.captureScreenshot`, isolated `storage_path` webview profile so it coexists with a running dev instance — WebView2 hard-fails 0x8007139F if two processes share a user-data folder with different args) and audited every page at 1280×800 and the ~760 px floor. The Vibe Canvas import held up almost everywhere; fixes: **photo page vertical overflow** (Capture button was below the fold — the "1280×800" window is only ~1024×640 CSS px under the owner's 125 % display scaling; viewfinder now `max-h-[44vh]` + trimmed `pt-20/pb-6`, ratio yields to the cap and object-cover crops), mood card label `SURPRISE` → `SURPRISED` (app vocabulary). The audit also caught and fixed the four live F7 bugs folded into the F7 notes above (env-var override, pause/navigate race, lying clock, paused-transfer no-op transport). Screenshot harness (launcher + `cdp.mjs`) lives in the session scratchpad — see memory `echosoul-cdp-screenshot-harness` for the recipe. Note: `DESIGN.md` is referenced by docs/FRONTEND.md + tailwind-config.js but does not exist in the repo (owner may hold it outside git).
  - **Track F — F9: manual UI test checklist (DONE, 2026-07-14) → Track F COMPLETE:** docs/TESTING.md's stale smoke checklist was rewritten to as-built and a new **"F9 — Track F exit checklist"** section added (7 passes: auth round-trips, camera E2E, mood path, playback, playlists, Free-mode degradation, window chrome). Owner ran all 7 passes on the real app — **all passed, no unexpected errors**: live-face FER, frame-rejection error pages matched their causes (`no_face`, `low_quality_blur` observed in the backend log), and a real mid-session Wi-Fi drop recovered into the same session after reconnect (the F2 "don't destroy the refresh token on transient network error" design, exercised for real — `verify_premium` raised the intended `SpotifyNetworkError`). Unit suite green at 131 tests. **Follow-up resolved (2026-07-14, owner chose disclose-over-block):** MediaPipe's built-in Google "clearcut" telemetry (usage events ~every 60 s; verified by binary inspection to be enum/key-value library-usage metadata with no image path — endpoint `play.googleapis.com/log`, protos `clientanalytics.proto` + `mediapipe_log_extension.proto`) is accepted and disclosed — analysis + ready-to-adapt report wording in `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` § "MediaPipe usage telemetry", pointer in CLAUDE.md §5.
  - **Playlist edit feature (DONE, 2026-07-14, owner-requested post-F9):** the result page's edit button is real — inline edit mode (title input + description textarea swapped in place, per-row remove-X with a one-song floor, Done/Cancel) in **both** views. New `playlist.description` column (migration **0005**, VARCHAR(500) NULL) + `playlists.update_playlist` (full transactional replace: header + songs, positions repack, `updated_at` bumped explicitly so a tracks-only edit still re-sorts the sidebar); `save_playlist` grew a trailing `description` param (bridge + backend). Save names lost the date stamp — default title = the per-emotion page title ("Happy Playlist"), default description = the per-emotion tagline; the created date moved to the sidebar subtitle (`25 songs · Jul 12`, new `formatCreatedDate` in `playlists_ui.js`) and a `· Created Jul 12` meta suffix on the playlist page. Fresh-view edits live in `sessionStorage.playlist_title`/`playlist_description` (loading.js clears both per new flow; stored empty string = deliberately cleared, don't re-default) and are picked up by the bookmark save, which keeps the returned id so post-save edits sync the DB copy via `update_playlist`. Unit suite at 146; migration applied to the local DB; docs (DATABASE/FRONTEND/TESTING Pass 5) updated. Not yet exercised in the real app.
  - **Header search (DONE, 2026-07-14, owner-requested post-F9):** the title-bar search box is live — as-you-type catalogue search (title + artists, word-prefix, most popular first, top 10; 250 ms debounce, ≥2 chars, stale-response guard) with a results dropdown on the five full-header pages (`frontend/js/search.js`; chrome.js renders `#header-search` + `#search-dropdown`). Row click plays the song (Premium: single-track `playTracks` queue; Free: opens in Spotify); a per-row add button opens a multi-select "add to saved playlists" popup — playlists already containing the song are shown checked + locked (`get_playlists_containing_track`) — with a success toast + `refreshSidebarPlaylists()`; adding to the saved playlist open on the result page reloads it after the toast so a later edit's working copy can't clobber the addition. Backend: `src/music/search.py` + migrations **0006** (FULLTEXT on `music(track_name, artists)`) and **0007** (`music_search_hot` — the ~116k popularity-valued rows of 1.31M, denormalised with their own FULLTEXT). ⚠️ The naive one-table query took 3–9 s on broad prefixes (ORDER BY popularity forces a row fetch per FULLTEXT match; measured against the default 128 MB buffer pool) — the two-tier plan (hot tier in true popularity order + relevance-ordered `music` top-up for the NULL-popularity tail, which uses InnoDB's early-terminating rank-sort path) answers in ~5–90 ms warm and matched ground-truth popularity order on every benchmark query. Boolean-query hygiene: operators stripped; short non-final tokens dropped (InnoDB `innodb_ft_min_token_size`=3: "7 rings" → `+rings*`); titles made only of 1–2-char words ("22") are unfindable — accepted + documented. `playlists.add_track_to_playlists` appends at max(position)+1, bumps `updated_at`, skips dupes/deleted playlists, one transaction. Docs: DATABASE.md § "Track search", FRONTEND.md § "Header search". Unit suite at 168. Not yet exercised in the real app.
  - **Sidebar create-playlist modal (DONE, 2026-07-14, owner-requested post-F9):** the sidebar's + button is real (`chrome.js` renders it as `#sidebar-new-playlist`; new module `frontend/js/create_playlist.js`, loaded on all six chrome pages). Two-step modal: (1) emotion picker — five tiles, accent-highlighted selection, Confirm/Cancel; (2) builder — emotion cover, title prefilled from the new shared `EMOTION_DEFAULT_TITLES` (`playlists_ui.js`; result.js's `EMOTIONS` titles now reference it), description **empty by default** (user-built ⇒ no generated tagline), a search box reusing the header bar's `search_tracks` query/debounce/stale-guard but with **inline results** (not a dropdown) and an explicit **"Add"** text button per row (replaces the icon to avoid confusion with the header search's add-popup; in-draft songs lock to "Added"), a removable added-songs list, and Cancel/Create (Create disabled until ≥1 song; emptied title falls back to the default). Row clicks preview like the header search (Premium in-app, Free/photo-page opens in Spotify — the photo page has no SDK device). The draft is **module-memory only** until Create calls `save_playlist` — invisible to `list_user_playlists`, so the add-to-playlists popup can't touch a half-built playlist; step 2 ignores backdrop/Esc so a stray click can't discard it. Create navigates to `result.html#playlist=<id>`. Frontend-only (no bridge/backend/schema changes); docs/FRONTEND.md § "Create playlist modal". Not yet exercised in the real app.
  - **Player shuffle dot + add button (DONE, 2026-07-15, owner-requested):** the bottom player's shuffle button now shows a small accent **dot** below the icon while shuffle is on (`#player-shuffle-dot`; the colour change alone was too easy to miss) and the queue placeholder became a real **add-to-playlist button** (`#player-add`) — the last `data-placeholder` in the app, so chrome.js's placeholder click handler is gone. The add button opens the same add-to-playlists popup as the header search, now extracted to a shared module (`frontend/js/add_to_playlists.js`; search.js re-uses it; the popup owns its Escape via a capture-phase listener so the search dropdown survives the first Esc). Key design point: the playing song can be **outside the EchoSoul catalogue** (queued from the user's own Spotify apps), so the player path passes `ensureInCatalogue: true` + the SDK state's metadata (name, ;-joined artists, album, duration) and the backend (`playlists.add_track_to_playlists` grew an optional `track_meta` param; the bridge sanitises to column shapes) inserts unknown tracks as **feature-less catalogue rows** — migration **0008** made `music.valence/energy/tempo` nullable. External rows replay from playlists like any song (playback only needs the track_id), are searchable (FULLTEXT auto-indexes them into the relevance tier), and are never emotion-recommended (BETWEEN and `v_in_scope_music` exclude NULLs); a stub whose target playlists all vanished mid-popup is deleted before commit. Relinked tracks prefer `linked_from.id` (the id our catalogue knows); episodes/ads keep the button disabled. Docs: DATABASE.md § "External tracks", FRONTEND.md player + header-search sections. Unit suite at 173; migration applied to the local DB. Not yet exercised in the real app.
  - **Genre filter — data layer (DONE, 2026-07-18, owner-requested):** groundwork for letting users pick genres for generated playlists. The raw `music.genre` column is a 3,994-value Last.fm folksonomy (synonyms like c-pop/mandopop/chinese, spelling variants, nationality/instrument/junk tags), so it was normalised into a **23-bucket owner-reviewed canonical vocabulary** via a three-layer mapping (exact decisions → ordered keyword rules → unmapped): 88.1% of labelled rows mapped, 7.5% deliberate junk, 4.4% unmapped tail noise. Source of truth `data/seed/genre_canonical_map.csv` (raw tag → bucket + layer + decision notes; owner approved the judgment calls incl. a separate **SEA Pop** bucket, 2026-07-18); migration **0009** (`music.canonical_genre` VARCHAR(50) NULL + `idx_music_canonical_genre` + column added to `v_in_scope_music`); idempotent backfill `scripts/apply_genre_mapping.py` (reset-then-apply; run: 1,027,885 rows set, per-bucket counts verified against the draft analysis). Emotion×genre viability was validated against the rule windows before building: only K-Pop×sad (18 candidates) falls under the default playlist size of 25. Docs: DATABASE.md § "Canonical genre"; tests `tests/db/test_canonical_genre.py`. **Recommender `genres` param + UI picker deliberately NOT built yet** — presentation/UX to be decided with the owner first.
  - **Genre filter — recommender + UI (DONE, 2026-07-18):** no extra step in the scan flow; the **home page chip is the single genre touchpoint** (owner simplified 2026-07-18: an initially-built result-page refine/re-roll row was removed as unnecessary), with the selection **sticky per session** (`sessionStorage.genre_filter`; absent = all = unfiltered path). Owner-specified picker semantics: multi-select over the 23 buckets, **all checked by default**, a **"Select all" tickbox** (all/none/indeterminate; unticking clears the board so a small selection is easy to build), **≥1 required to Apply** (button disabled at zero), **no per-bucket counts** (aim is relatability, not statistics); thin picks yield a shorter playlist + explanatory note. Long bucket names wrap in the tiles (no ellipsis). Home chip sits in its own section between the scanner hero and the manual mood picker. Backend: `generate_playlist(..., genres=None)` runs **one sample_key-windowed query per bucket** on migration **0010**'s `idx_music_genre_sample_vet` (equality prefix ⇒ native order, no filesort; verified live: `range` + ICP, 11–250 ms incl. all-23-bucket worst case; genres deduped+sorted so seeds stay deterministic; merged windows deliberately weight picked genres ~equally) + `list_genre_buckets()`; bridge `generate_playlist` grew a sanitised `genres` arg + cached `get_genre_buckets`. Frontend: new `frontend/js/genre_filter.js` (state + create-playlist-style modal with first-approach explainer copy), home chip `#genre-filter-chip` (label mirrors state, tinted when live), result-page `#genre-filter-row` (accent chips + "Change genres" re-roll; regenerated list resets an earlier bookmark save — it's a new unsaved playlist; empty result rolls the sticky filter back), `loading.js` passes the filter on every generation. Docs: RECOMMENDATION.md § "Genre filtering" (records the CP1 no-genre decision reversal), FRONTEND.md § "Genre filter". Note: an emotion-window boundary track can differ between SQL-side float comparison and Python-passed rule bounds (K-Pop×sad measured 18 in analysis vs 17 at runtime) — long-standing recommender behaviour, documented, not a bug. Unit suite at 192. **Verified live over CDP (2026-07-18):** home chip placement + label states, picker default/none/partial (tickbox + indeterminate + Apply gating), and the manual sad + K-Pop-only flow end-to-end on the real backend — result page rendered 17 tracks with the accent chip row and the thin-pool note.
- **Current focus:** Phase 4 — Integration & Testing: the `@pytest.mark.integration` suite from docs/TESTING.md (test DB strategy A: `echosoul_test` schema + fixture catalogue), performance measurements on target hardware, then the user study.
- **Next milestone:** Phase 4 complete (integration suite green, performance actuals + user-study results in `docs/TEST_RESULTS.md`).

## Out of scope (do not build these)

The capstone plan explicitly excludes these features. If a task asks for them, push back and confirm with the owner:

- Mobile app (Android/iOS).
- Wearable / physiological sensor emotion detection.
- Lyrics-based emotion analysis.
- Long-term personalisation (user listening-history-based ranking).
- Full music licensing / payment flows.
- Multi-user accounts inside the desktop app (each install is single-user).
- Cloud backup of playlists.
- Real-time continuous emotion tracking (one snapshot per request only).
