The HTML/CSS/JS layer that runs inside the PyWebView window.

For the Python side of the bridge, see `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` and the `api/` module. For UI requirements that come from the planning doc, see CP1 §3.5 (Low-Fidelity Prototypes).

## Stack choices

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | None — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | Minimum dependencies for a solo capstone. No build step. |
| Module system | Native ES modules (`<script type="module">`) for bridge logic; plain scripts for the imported design pages | Supported in Chromium-based webviews. No bundler needed. |
| CSS approach | Tailwind utility classes via a **vendored** Tailwind Play build (`js/vendor/tailwind.js`, JIT in-browser, **no build step**) + shared `css/app.css` (custom effects) + `css/fonts.css` (self-hosted webfonts) | The high-fidelity prototype was authored in Google Stitch on Tailwind. Vendoring the Play build keeps it pixel-faithful and fully offline without a Node build step. Tailwind is a CSS utility layer, **not** a JS framework — the "no React/Vue" rule still holds. |
| Templating | None — DOM manipulation directly | Pages are few and simple |
| Routing | Window-level navigation between HTML files | PyWebView allows `window.location = 'pages/result.html'`; no SPA router needed |
| Audio | Spotify Web Playback SDK | See `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` |
| Webcam | `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` (built-in) | No library required |

**Do not** introduce React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework. The owner is a sole developer; the frontend is small enough that vanilla JS stays cleanest.

## High-fidelity design import (MoodStream / "Vibe Canvas")

The CP2 high-fidelity prototype was designed in **Google Stitch** and exported as Tailwind HTML (see the *Prototype Interfaces Code* PDF and `DESIGN.md`). It has been imported as **static, faithful pages** — full look-and-feel with plain `window.location` navigation between screens, but **no Python bridge calls yet**. The bridge/camera/playback wiring described further down is layered on next, replacing the placeholder navigation.

Vendored, fully-offline dependencies (no internet needed to render):

- `frontend/js/vendor/tailwind.js` — Tailwind Play build (with the `forms` + `container-queries` plugins). JITs utilities in-browser; no build step.
- `frontend/js/tailwind-config.js` — shared theme (colours / type / spacing tokens). Loaded **immediately after** `tailwind.js` on every page.
- `frontend/css/fonts.css` — self-hosted Inter (400/500/600), Montserrat (600/700) and Material Symbols Outlined (`frontend/assets/fonts/*.woff2`).
- `frontend/css/app.css` — hand-written effects from the prototype `<style>` blocks (entrance animation, scrollbar, camera/scanner/glass/glow/progress).

Content imagery from the Stitch export (avatars, album art, hero/emoji/illustration graphics) pointed at expiring Google CDN URLs, so it is replaced with on-brand **Material Symbols** placeholders and gradient tiles. Real artwork arrives at runtime (Spotify profile avatar, album covers from the catalogue).

### Custom title bar (frameless window)

The window is created with `frameless=True` (`src/main.py`), so the OS title
bar is gone and `js/titlebar.js` provides the replacement on **every** page:

- **Chrome pages** (`#app-header` exists): minimize / maximize / close buttons
  are appended into the top app bar and the bar's spare flex space becomes the
  drag region — Spotify-desktop style, no extra bar, no layout change. Load
  order matters: `chrome.js` → `titlebar.js` → page script.
- **Pre-auth pages** (gate / login / premium, no header): a slim transparent
  overlay strip is injected across the top (brand mark left, controls right).
- Dragging: pywebview turns any element with the `pywebview-drag-region` class
  into a drag handle (`easy_drag` is off so page content never drags the
  window). Double-clicking a drag region toggles maximize.
- The buttons call the `window_minimize` / `window_toggle_maximize` /
  `window_close` / `window_is_maximized` bridge methods (`src/api/bridge.py`),
  which drive the pywebview window; maximized state is read from the native
  form so Win+Arrow snapping can't desync the toggle icon.
- **Resizing:** pywebview's WinForms backend does not hit-test resize borders
  on frameless windows, so `titlebar.js` injects invisible strips along all
  four edges + corners (`data-resize`, resize cursors). A pointer drag first
  calls `window_begin_resize(edge)` — which captures the anchor rectangle
  **once** and returns the starting size — then streams `window_resize(w, h)`
  steps, each an absolute Win32 `SetWindowPos` computed from that fixed
  anchor. ⚠️ Do **not** use pywebview's `resize(fix_point=...)` for this: it
  re-reads the form's cached bounds on every call, and under a fast drag those
  reads race the UI thread's updates — the error compounds until the window
  walks off-screen (observed live). Sizes clamp to the shared minimum
  (`MIN_WINDOW_WIDTH/HEIGHT` in `src/api/bridge.py`). JS CSS pixels differ
  from native pixels under Windows display scaling, so the drag calibrates a
  scale factor from the begin-call's size / `window.outerWidth`. Handles are
  inert while maximized. Note: drag-to-screen-edge Aero snap does not trigger
  (drag/resize are programmatic); Win+Arrow snapping still works.
- `src/main.py` additionally sets the title-bar/taskbar icon (WinForms
  `Form.Icon` via `Form.Invoke` — pywebview's `icon` kwarg is GTK/QT-only) and
  asks DWM to round the frameless window's corners on Windows 11.

### Shared chrome & responsiveness

The sidebar, top app bar and bottom player were duplicated verbatim in every
page. They are now defined **once** in `js/chrome.js` and injected per page.

- Each page sets `<body data-page="home|mood|photo|loading|result|error">`;
  `chrome.js` reads it to decide which header to render (full app bar vs the
  simplified "back" header on `photo.html`), whether to show the bottom player,
  and whether to show the sidebar "Scan Emotion" button.
- `chrome.js` is the **last** script before the page's own script and runs
  synchronously during body parse, so the injected nodes exist (and are present
  at `DOMContentLoaded`, so Tailwind JIT styles them) before page code runs.
- Navigation is wired by event delegation on `[data-nav]` (home / scan / back /
  forward / open-sidebar / close-sidebar). Controls with no backend yet (the
  player's queue button, the sidebar's Recents row) carry `data-placeholder`
  and are no-ops for now. The bottom player itself is rendered idle here and
  driven live by `js/playback.js`; the header search box is rendered here and
  driven live by `js/search.js` (see *Header search* below).
- **Responsive:** at `lg` (≥1024px) the layout is the fixed 280px sidebar + main
  canvas. Below `lg` the sidebar becomes an off-canvas drawer toggled by the
  header hamburger (with a dimming backdrop), the main column goes full width
  (`lg:ml-[280px]` → `ml-0`), the mood-card grid restacks, the tracklist drops
  its Album column (`.track-grid` / `.track-col-album` in `app.css`), and the
  player hides the waveform + secondary controls. Target floor ≈ 700px wide.

Each imported page's `<head>` uses this boilerplate (paths relative to `pages/`):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/fonts.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/app.css">
<script src="../js/vendor/tailwind.js"></script>
<script src="../js/tailwind-config.js"></script>
```

---

## Routing

Plain `<a href>` and `window.location.assign()` between HTML files. No History API gymnastics.

Each page's `<head>` includes the same boilerplate:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Emotion Music Rec</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/base.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/sidebar.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/pages/<page-name>.css">
  <script type="module" src="../js/bridge.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="../js/sidebar.js"></script>
  <script type="module" src="../js/<page-name>.js"></script>
</head>
```

The Spotify SDK does not survive file navigation: **it reinitialises on every page** (each page is a fresh document). As-built, `js/playback.js` loads the SDK on each chrome page that shows the bottom player and bridges the gap with Spotify's server-side session — the outgoing page stashes whether music was playing (`sessionStorage.playback_resume`), the incoming page's new SDK device transfers the session to itself and resumes mid-track after a sub-second gap. See `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` > "Page navigation & session resume" (including the autoplay-policy flag `src/main.py` sets to allow the un-gestured resume).

**Decision:** Keep file navigation; the resume gap is acceptable. If it ever isn't, refactor to a single `index.html` with hash routes.

---

## The bridge wrapper

PyWebView's `pywebview.api.method(...)` returns a Promise. Wrap it for consistent error handling (as-built in `frontend/js/bridge.js`):

```javascript
// frontend/js/bridge.js (abridged — see the module)
const BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_MS = 30000;

export async function callPy(method, ...args) {
  return callPyWithTimeout(BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_MS, method, ...args);
}

export async function callPyWithTimeout(timeoutMs, method, ...args) {
  // Promise.race between the bridge invocation and a timeout rejection.
  // The invocation first awaits bridgeReady(): resolves immediately when
  // window.pywebview.api exists, else waits for the `pywebviewready` event
  // (pitfall #5 below — fast page loads can beat the bridge injection).
}
```

Use it as: `const result = await callPy("detect_emotion", base64Image);`

The 30-second default timeout is a guard against the Python side hanging (e.g. model loading failing silently). 30 seconds is generous — actual end-to-end should be < 5 s. **Exception:** `start_spotify_login` legitimately blocks while the user completes OAuth in their browser (Python waits up to 180 s), so `login.js` calls it via `callPyWithTimeout(190000, "start_spotify_login")` — Python must time out first so its specific error message, not a generic bridge timeout, reaches the user.

---

## Page-by-page detail

### `index.html` — auth gate

Single responsibility: check session state and redirect.

```javascript
// frontend/js/auth_gate.js (as-built; the module adds a status line)
import { callPy } from "./bridge.js";

// Bridge rejections carry the Python exception class name as error.name
// (pywebview sets it from type(e).__name__). These classes raise with a
// user-facing message, shown verbatim on the login page — see
// docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md > Refresh for the full table.
const USER_FACING_ERRORS = new Set([
  "SpotifyUserNotRegisteredError", // account not in the app's dev-mode allowlist
  "SpotifySessionExpiredError", // refresh token revoked/expired — re-login fixes it
  "SpotifyNetworkError", // offline / Spotify unreachable — retry fixes it
]);

window.addEventListener("load", async () => {
  try {
    if (!(await callPy("has_spotify_session"))) {
      window.location.replace("pages/login.html");
      return;
    }
    const profile = await callPy("verify_premium");
    if (!profile.premium) {
      window.location.replace("pages/premium_required.html");
      return;
    }
    // Save profile to sessionStorage for sidebar / header use
    sessionStorage.setItem("spotify_profile", JSON.stringify(profile));
    window.location.replace("pages/home.html");
  } catch (err) {
    // Session unusable. Deliberately NOT calling logout — a transient network
    // failure must not destroy a good refresh token. A fresh login overwrites
    // the cache anyway. Known failures (allowlist rejection, revoked refresh
    // token, network down) show their own actionable message from Python;
    // anything unexpected falls back to the generic notice.
    const notice = USER_FACING_ERRORS.has(err?.name)
      ? err.message
      : "We couldn't restore your Spotify session. Please log in again.";
    sessionStorage.setItem("login_notice", notice);
    window.location.replace("pages/login.html");
  }
});
```

`location.replace` (not `assign`) keeps the gate page out of the back-history, so the header's Back button never re-runs the gate.

### `login.html`

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Emotion Music Recommender      │
│                                     │

│                                     │
│   Requires Spotify Premium account  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```javascript
// frontend/js/login.js (abridged — see the module)
import { callPyWithTimeout } from "./bridge.js";

const LOGIN_TIMEOUT_MS = 190000; // > Python's 180 s LOGIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS

els.loginBtn.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  els.loginBtn.disabled = true;
  setStatus("Opening Spotify in your browser… finish logging in there.");
  try {
    const result = await callPyWithTimeout(LOGIN_TIMEOUT_MS, "start_spotify_login");
    if (result.success) {
      window.location.replace("../index.html");  // re-runs the auth gate
      return;
    }
    setStatus(result.error, true);
  } catch (err) {
    setStatus(err.message, true);
  }
  els.loginBtn.disabled = false;
});
```

The page also shows the one-shot `sessionStorage.login_notice` left by the auth gate — a specific notice where the cause is known (account not allowlisted, session expired/revoked, Spotify unreachable; see `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` > Refresh) or the generic "couldn't restore your session" otherwise.

### `premium_required.html`

Hard block for Free accounts (see `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` > Premium verification). Three actions, wired in `js/premium_required.js`:

- **Get Spotify Premium** → `callPy("open_external_url", "https://www.spotify.com/premium/")` — opens the **system** browser via an allowlisted bridge method; the webview itself must never navigate away from the app.
- **I've upgraded — check again** → `location.replace("../index.html")`, re-running the gate (`verify_premium()` does a fresh `/me` fetch).
- **Use a different account** → `callPy("logout")` then `login.html`.

It also shows a best-effort "Logged in as X (free account)" line from `get_user_profile`.

### `home.html`

Layout (planning doc Figure 17):

```

```javascript
document.querySelector("#take-photo-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  window.location.assign("photo.html");
});
document.querySelector("#manual-mood-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  window.location.assign("mood.html");
});
```

As-built addition: below the scanner hero and the mood chips, `home.js` renders
a **"Your latest playlist"** showcase — the newest saved playlist
(`list_user_playlists[0]` → `load_playlist`) with cover, meta line and the
first 5 tracks (plus a "View all N songs" row). The section stays hidden while
nothing has been saved yet. Title and the "Open playlist" button open
`result.html#playlist=<id>`; the **cover's hover button** is themed to the
emotion accent (yellow neutral, blue sad, red angry, … — dark-navy glyph;
same treatment as the result page's cover overlay) and, for Premium, plays
the whole playlist in-app via `playTracks` (filled play glyph). Free accounts
keep the arrow glyph and the cover opens the playlist view instead.

### `photo.html`

Two states, as-built in `js/camera.js` (which replaced the placeholder `photo.js`):

1. **Preview** — `getUserMedia` (1280×720 ideal, user-facing) streams into
   `#webcam-preview`, mirrored via CSS for a natural selfie view (the captured
   data itself is **not** mirrored). Every 500 ms a ≤320 px JPEG frame goes to
   `quick_face_check` and the oval guide (`#face-guide`) turns green (exactly
   one face) or red (none / several); the status line under the viewfinder
   explains, and `#capture-btn` is enabled only on green. The loop is a
   chained `setTimeout` with an in-flight guard — never more than one ping on
   the bridge at once, so slow calls (e.g. FER warm-up holding the lock) can't
   pile up; each ping has a 5 s timeout and a failed ping just locks the
   shutter and keeps trying.
2. **Captured** — the shutter grabs the **full-resolution frame as lossless
   PNG** (JPEG artefacts could distort facial features — see
   `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md`), freezes it in `#captured-preview`, and shows
   **Retake** / **Use this photo**. "Use" stashes the base64 payload in
   `sessionStorage.captured_image_b64` with `emotion_source = "camera"` and
   navigates to `loading.html`, which runs `detect_emotion`.

Camera lifecycle: the stream stops on `pagehide` (the camera light never stays
on after leaving the page) and before navigating to loading. If the camera
can't start (permission denied / no device), the status line says why and a
"Try camera again" button appears; the shutter stays disabled.

The live guide is purely a UI aid — the authoritative single-face gate and
quality checks still run inside `detect_emotion` on the shutter frame. If the
2 Hz ping ever proves too slow on target hardware, fall back to client-side
detection (browser `FaceDetector` / face-api.js) — not needed so far.

### `mood.html`

```

```javascript
// frontend/js/mood.js (as-built)
let picked = false;
document.querySelectorAll(".mood-card").forEach((card) => {
  card.addEventListener("click", () => {
    if (picked) return; // already navigating; a second card must not win
    picked = true;
    sessionStorage.setItem("last_emotion", card.dataset.emotion);
    sessionStorage.setItem("emotion_source", "manual");
    // Manual picks skip inference — drop any capture left over from an
    // abandoned photo run (a full-res PNG is multi-MB of sessionStorage).
    sessionStorage.removeItem("captured_image_b64");
    window.location.assign("loading.html");
  });
});
```

The quick emotion chips on `home.html` (`.mood-chip` in `home.js`) do exactly
the same, skipping the mood page entirely. `loading.html` takes no query
parameter — `loading.js` branches on `sessionStorage.emotion_source` alone.

### `loading.html`

The bridge work happens directly on this page (`js/loading.js`, a module), then
it navigates to result or error. As-built flow:

- **Camera path** (`emotion_source === "camera"`): reads
  `sessionStorage.captured_image_b64` and **removes it immediately** (consumed
  either way — multi-MB of PNG must not outlive the one call that needs it),
  then `callPy("detect_emotion", b64)`.
  - `status === "out_of_scope"` → `error_code = "out_of_scope"`,
    `detected_emotion = result.detected` → error.html.
  - `status === "error"` → `error_code = result.error` (no_face,
    multiple_faces, low_quality_*, decode_failed) → error.html.
  - `status === "ok"` → `last_emotion = result.emotion`, continue.
- **Manual path** (`"manual"`): the emotion is already in
  `sessionStorage.last_emotion` (mood card / home chip); inference is skipped.
- **Both**: `callPy("generate_playlist", emotion)` (backend default size, 25)
  → `current_playlist` (JSON) + `playlist_emotion` → result.html. An empty
  list maps to `error_code = "playlist_failed"`; a rejected bridge promise
  (backend raised / timed out) maps to `"unexpected"`.
- Landing here with no flow behind it (deep link, stale history) goes straight
  home rather than erroring.

Two as-built details:

- **Every exit uses `location.replace`** — the page is transient and its
  inputs are consumed on the way through, so the Back button must never
  re-enter it (history after a camera run reads photo → result).
- **Minimum display time** (~1.5 s from load to navigation): the manual path
  is one fast DB query and the analyzing animation would otherwise flash for a
  frame, which reads as a glitch.
- **Staged progress bar** (`#loading-progress`, width + CSS transition): a
  bridge call is one opaque await — no real percentage exists — so the fill
  glides toward the running stage's cap (55% during `detect_emotion`, 90%
  during `generate_playlist`, slower than any healthy call takes) and the
  finishing fill to 100% is timed to land just before navigation, inside the
  minimum-display window. Error exits leave the bar where it stopped. The
  shimmer sweep (`.progress-bar-fill` in `app.css`) stays on top.

The status lines (`#loading-status` / `#loading-substatus`) switch from the
static "Analyzing Emotion..." copy to "Building your playlist..." when
inference is done.

**sessionStorage caveat:** Spotify Playback SDK uses localStorage; we use sessionStorage for app state. PyWebView shares storage between pages within the same window. Confirm both work in early build verification.

```

As-built (detection view, `js/result.js`): reads `current_playlist` +
`playlist_emotion` (stashed by loading.js). If either is missing or unusable
(deep link, stale history) the page heads home — there is nothing real to
show. Otherwise it themes the mood banner per emotion and renders the real
tracks via the shared `playlists_ui.js` helpers. The header is title +
description + meta line: the title defaults to the per-emotion page title
("Happy Playlist"), the description (`#playlist-description`, hidden when
empty) defaults to the per-emotion tagline ("Curated for your joyful
moments"), and the meta line is the real `formatPlaylistMeta` counts plus
`· Created Jul 12` once the playlist is saved (saved view: always). User
customisations live in `sessionStorage.playlist_title` /
`playlist_description` (loading.js clears both when a new flow starts; a
stored *empty* description means "cleared on purpose", so it doesn't
re-default).

Buttons under the title:

- **Save** (`#save-playlist-btn`, bookmark icon): calls
  `save_playlist(name, emotion, track_ids, description)` with the current
  (default or user-edited) title and description — **no date stamp in the
  name**; repeat saves of the same mood are tellable apart by the created
  date in the sidebar subtitle. On success the bookmark fills with the
  emotion accent, the button stays disabled (double-saving only clutters the
  sidebar), a toast confirms, `refreshSidebarPlaylists()` (imported from
  `sidebar.js`) shows the new row live, and the returned `playlist_id` is
  kept so later edits on the same page update the saved copy. On failure the
  button re-enables with an error toast. The saved view (`#playlist=<id>`)
  removes this button — it's already saved.
- **Play-all** (`#playlist-play-btn`, and the cover's hover overlay — the
  overlay button is tinted to the emotion accent with a dark-navy glyph):
  starts the whole list on the in-app SDK device via `playTracks(trackIds, 0)`
  (imported from `playback.js`). Clicking a **track row** starts the list *at
  that track*, so prev/next on the bottom player walk the playlist. Failures
  surface as a toast. All of it removed in Free mode.
- **Edit** (`#edit-playlist-btn`, pencil icon — both views, Free mode too):
  switches the header into **inline edit mode**: the title and description
  swap to an underline input / textarea in place, the action row is replaced
  by Done/Cancel, and the tracklist re-renders with a remove (X) button per
  row (inert rows — no play/open handlers while editing; the X disables at
  one remaining track, a playlist keeps at least one song). Nothing applies
  until **Done**: fresh view updates the sessionStorage state (so the
  bookmark save persists the customised version); any view backed by a DB
  row (saved view, or fresh-after-save) persists via
  `update_playlist(playlist_id, name, description, track_ids)` — a full
  replace, so removals repack positions — then refreshes the sidebar.
  `update_playlist` returning false (deleted from the sidebar mid-edit)
  routes home. Cancel discards. Adding tracks happens via the header search
  (see *Header search*), not inside edit mode.

Toasts are a DIY 10-liner shared from playlists_ui.js (PyWebView has no reliable
`alert()`): a fixed bottom-centre pill that fades after ~2 s.

As-built addition — **saved-playlist view**: when the page is opened as
`result.html#playlist=<id>` (sidebar rows, home showcase), `result.js` drops
the mood banner (a saved playlist isn't a fresh detection) and renders the
stored playlist from `load_playlist`: real tracks, the stored description
(hidden if none), a songs-and-duration meta line ending in
`· Created Jul 12`, and the per-emotion accent (theme primary for
user-created playlists with no source emotion). The edit button works here
too (persists via `update_playlist`). Free accounts get the same degradation
as the detection view — no play-all affordances, each track opens in Spotify
via its real `track_id`. A deleted/unknown id shows "Playlist not found".
The page reloads itself on `hashchange` so sidebar clicks that only change
the hash re-render.

### `error.html`

Shows a message keyed by `sessionStorage.error_code` (`js/error_handler.js`):

```javascript
const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  no_face:           "We couldn't see a face. Please centre your face in the frame and try again.",
  multiple_faces:    "We detected more than one face. Please make sure only one person is in the photo.",
  low_quality_blur:  "The image is too blurry. Please hold the camera steady.",
  low_quality_dark:  "The image is too dark. Move to a brighter spot.",
  low_quality_bright:"The image is too bright. Reduce glare or move away from direct light.",
  decode_failed:     "Something went wrong reading the photo. Please try again.",
  playlist_failed:   "We couldn't build a playlist just now. Please try again in a moment.",
  out_of_scope:      detected => `We detected ${detected}, which isn't supported for music recommendations. Try choosing your mood manually.`,
};
// Unknown codes (incl. "unexpected") fall back to
// "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again."
```

As-built details: the keys are read, not consumed, so refreshing the page
keeps the message; opened with no `error_code` at all (design preview) the
static prototype copy stays. "Back to Home Page" is a plain `<a href>`.

## Sidebar (shared across pages)

As-built: `chrome.js` renders the sidebar shell with an empty
`#sidebar-playlists` container on every chrome page; `js/sidebar.js` (a module
loaded right after `chrome.js`/`titlebar.js` on all six pages) fills it from
`list_user_playlists` on every page load (cheap query, newest-updated first).

Each row shows the emotion emoji (from `playlists_ui.js`'s `EMOTION_THEMES`;
`music_note` for user-created playlists without a source emotion), the name and
a `25 songs · Jul 12` subtitle (`formatCreatedDate` on the row's `created_at`;
the year is appended once it differs from the current one). Interactions:

- **Click** → opens `result.html#playlist=<id>` (the saved-playlist view). The
  row of the playlist currently open on the result page is highlighted.
  `result.js` reloads on `hashchange`, so switching playlists while already on
  the result page works.
- **Kebab menu (⋯, appears on hover)** → **Rename** (inline input in place;
  Enter commits via `rename_playlist`, Esc/blur cancels) and **Delete** (the
  menu item turns into "Confirm delete?" — the second click calls
  `delete_playlist`; PyWebView doesn't reliably support `window.confirm`).
  Deleting the playlist currently open on the result page navigates home.

### Header profile chip (chrome.js)

The top-right circle shows the first letter of the Spotify display name from
`sessionStorage.spotify_profile` (stashed by the auth gate for Premium users
and by `premium_required.js` for Free mode); the generic person icon stays when
no profile is stashed. Clicking it opens an account dropdown — display name,
email, Premium/Free badge — with a **Log out** button that calls the `logout`
bridge method (directly via `pywebview.api`, since `chrome.js` is a plain
script) and returns to `login.html`. The notifications button was removed
(owner decision, July 2026).

### Header search (js/search.js)

`chrome.js` renders the search input (`#header-search`) plus an empty dropdown
container (`#search-dropdown`) in the full header; `js/search.js` (a module on
the five full-header pages — home / mood / loading / result / error) drives
them. The photo page's "back" header has no search box, so the module no-ops
there.

- **As-you-type search:** 250 ms debounce, minimum 2 characters, stale-response
  guard (only the latest call may render). Calls the `search_tracks` bridge
  method — FULLTEXT word-prefix match on title + artists, most popular first,
  10 results (see `docs/DATABASE.md` § "Track search"). States: "Searching…",
  results, `No songs found for "q"`, and an error message if the bridge call
  rejects. Esc or clicking outside closes the dropdown; refocusing the input
  with the same text re-opens the cached results.
- **Row click = play.** Premium: `playTracks([track_id])` (single-track queue
  on the SDK device, toast on failure). Free: opens the song in Spotify via
  `openInSpotify` (same degradation as the tracklists).
- **Add button (playlist_add icon)** opens a modal popup listing every saved
  playlist (`list_user_playlists`) as a checkbox row (emotion emoji, name,
  song count). Playlists already containing the song
  (`get_playlists_containing_track`) are shown **checked and disabled** with an
  "Added" hint. Confirm calls `add_track_to_playlists` — the song lands at the
  end of each chosen playlist and each one's `updated_at` is bumped (the
  sidebar re-sorts). On success: transient toast (`Added to N playlists`),
  `refreshSidebarPlaylists()`, and — if one of the affected playlists is open
  on the result page — a delayed `location.reload()` so its tracklist (and any
  later edit's working copy) isn't stale. No saved playlists → the popup says
  so and Confirm stays disabled.

## Spotify SDK integration (js/playback.js)

`playback.js` is a module loaded on the five chrome pages that show the bottom
player (home / mood / loading / result / error). It injects the SDK script
dynamically (with an `onerror` "Playback unavailable" fallback for offline),
initialises the `Spotify.Player` (device name **EchoSoul**, token via the
`get_spotify_access_token` bridge method), and:

- **drives the bottom player** chrome.js renders idle: now-playing title /
  artists / album art, play-pause / prev / next, the waveform bars as a live
  progress + seek bar (1 s `getCurrentState` poll while playing), shuffle,
  and a hover-revealed volume slider + mute toggle (volume persists across
  pages via sessionStorage). Transport commands go through the Spotify Web
  API rather than the SDK's local methods — after a paused cross-page
  transfer the SDK's own togglePlay/nextTrack/seek silently no-op (see
  `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md`). The transport stays disabled until a
  playback session exists.
- **resumes the session across page navigations** — see the Routing section
  above and `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` for the stash/transfer mechanics.
- **exports `playTracks(trackIds, startIndex)`**, the one entry point other
  modules use (result.js).

For Free accounts chrome.js doesn't render the player and `playback.js`
no-ops; on Premium pages the Premium check has already passed at the gate, so
`playback.js` can assume Premium (the SDK's `account_error` is still handled,
just not expected).

## Styling notes

The realised design system is **"Vibe Canvas"** (dark, glassmorphic). Tokens live in `js/tailwind-config.js`; the canonical reference is `DESIGN.md`.

- **Colour palette:** deep navy-charcoal surfaces (`background`/`surface` `#0b1326`, tiered `surface-container*` greys), soft-purple **primary** (`#ddb7ff`) for actions/active states, emerald **secondary** (`#4edea3`) for play/success. Result page applies an emotion-specific accent (happy → green, surprised → teal-green, sad → blue, neutral → amber, angry → red) — see `js/result.js`.
- **Typography:** Montserrat for headlines, Inter for body/labels — self-hosted (latin subset) in `css/fonts.css`, no network needed. Icons via the self-hosted Material Symbols Outlined variable font.
- **Layout:** fixed 280px sidebar + main canvas (max 1440px) + fixed 64px top app bar + fixed 96px bottom player. Flexbox throughout; CSS Grid for the mood card grid and the tracklist columns.
- **Sizing:** target 1280×800 minimum.
- **Elevation:** tonal layering + glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur`, 1px white/10 borders, primary-tinted soft shadows). Buttons are pill-shaped; cards/inputs use `rounded-lg` (8px), hero/scanner use `rounded-xl`+.

The planning doc's prototypes (Figures 17–22) were low-fidelity; the high-fidelity prototype (this Stitch/MoodStream export) is now imported — see *High-fidelity design import* above.

## Testing the frontend

For a vanilla JS app, manual testing is the default. Automated frontend tests are out of scope for CP1/CP2.

Manual test checklist (recorded in `docs/TESTING.md`):
- Cold start with no session → login flow appears.
- Login completes → home appears.
- Take photo with one face → result appears with a playlist.
- Take photo with no face → error page with correct message.
- Take photo with two faces → error page with correct message.
- Manual mood selection → result appears.
- Click play on a track → audio plays.
- Save a playlist → appears in sidebar after refresh.
- Delete a saved playlist → disappears from sidebar.
- Logout → returns to login.

## Common frontend pitfalls

1. **Forgetting `type="module"` on scripts that use `import`.** Browser silently fails. Use the dev tools console to verify.
2. **CORS issues calling Spotify Web API from `file://`-served pages.** PyWebView serves pages from `file://` by default. Spotify's API has permissive CORS, but some older endpoints don't. If a `fetch` to Spotify fails with CORS, route the call through Python.
3. **Webcam permission denied silently.** First-time `getUserMedia` prompts the OS for camera permission. On macOS this requires app-level entitlements; document the first-launch dialog.
4. **`sessionStorage` cleared on navigation.** It isn't — `sessionStorage` persists within the same window/tab. Don't confuse it with `localStorage`.
5. **PyWebView API not ready.** On very fast page loads, `pywebview.api.*` may not be available yet. Always wait for the `pywebviewready` event before first bridge call, or check `window.pywebview` exists.
